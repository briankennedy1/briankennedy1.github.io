    <p>We've been focusing on Ruby objects this week at Dev Bootcamp. It's starting to click for me, so I'd like to share a bit of what I've learned.</p>
    <p>Ruby's object-oriented nature makes it easy to model real-world things. The classic beginner example is creating a die object.</p>
    <p>A normal die has 6 sides and from 1 to 6 dots on each side. If you roll a die your result is a number between 1 and 6.</p>
    <p>Here's what that simple object looks like in Ruby:</p>
    <p><script src="https://gist.github.com/briankennedy1/f68705c5e98632094ae3.js"></script></p>
    <p>Like I said, this is the basic example. Let's crank it up a notch.</p>
    <h3>X-Men trading card objects</h3>

    <p>X-Men trading cards are interesting real-world objects. The <a href="http://www.uncannyxmen.net/cards/x-men-series-1-1992">1992 X-Men set by Impel</a> contains 100 common cards and 5 rare, randomly inserted hologram cards.</p>
    <p>You buy the cards in a pack, and a pack contains 6 cards. If I recall correctly, 1 in 9 packs had a hologram card inserted.</p>
    <p>Let's break that down again:</p>
    <p>
    <ul>
    	<li>6 random cards per pack</li>
    	<li>1/9 chance to get a rare card</li>
    	<li>100 common cards in the set</li>
    	<li>5 rare cards in the set</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
	<p>Let's translate this into a Ruby object. I see us having methods like pack#buy (fills a pack with random cards) and pack#unwrap (reveals the contents of the cards.</p>
	<p>The tricky part will be filling the pack with cards, especially the random hologram cards.</p>
	<p>Let's give it a try:</p>
	<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/briankennedy1/a24cfbbfc35ca7a42f75.js"></script></p>
	<p>Holy crap, when I ran my first test of unwrapping four packs I got two hologram cards! Way too lucky! I also got a couple of the same cards in different packs, which is normal.</p>

        <p>Here's the rest of my cards:</p>
