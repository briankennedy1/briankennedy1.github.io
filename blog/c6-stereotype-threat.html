    <p>Even though I have not felt stereotype threat personally, I know that others in my cohort are feeling the pressure.</p>
    <p>One of my main goals at DBC is to make as many true friendships as possible. The bonds that we will form over our tireless pursuit of coding excellence will be strong.</p>
    <p>And even though I'm not feeling the pressures of stereotype threat yet, I will do my best to support my fellow DBC mates and create an environment where we are all pulling for each other.</p>
    <p>Showing respect and appreciation to my DBC cohort is a top priority. We've already begun to bond in our hangouts and chat rooms. I can't wait to get on site.</p>
