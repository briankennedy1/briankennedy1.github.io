    <p>I don't remember exactly when my journey of self-improvement started. I've always been curious about people, goals and why some succeed and others fail.</p>
    <p>I got serious about setting goals and moving twoards them around this time last year.</p>
    <p>Learning web programming and JavaScript has been on my list of goals forever, but I had only dabbled and played around with it in years past.</p>
    <p>But by the end of last year I got serious and it led me to Dev Bootcamp. Quitting my job and entering an intensive course seemed like just the ticket to level up my skills.</p>
    <p>I've been telling myself "If you're not growing you're dying" and "You get out what you put in".</p>
    <p>These mantras really mean something to me. In my eyes they are the truths of the universe.</p>
    <p>DBC asked us to explore our values and think about the times we've been happiest and most satisfied and what key words are associated with those moments.</p>
    <p>"Challenge" comes to mind first and foremost. My must satisfied days at work were when I automated some repetitive process. Every time I sat down and chipped away at a problem I was able to make a break through. It's almost like magic.</p>
    <p>"Close relationships" are also incredibly important for me. My best memories are laughing with my brother and best friends. When you're having trouble breathing, you know it's funny.</p>
