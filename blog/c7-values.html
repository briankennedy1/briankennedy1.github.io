    <p>I don't remember exactly when my journey of self-improvement started. I've always been curious about people, goals and why some succeed and others fail.</p>
    <p>I got serious about setting goals and moving twoards them around this time last year.</p>
    <p>Learning web programming and JavaScript has been on my list of goals forever, but I had only dabbled and played around with it in years past.</p>
    <p>But by the end of last year I got serious and it led me to Dev Bootcamp. Quitting my job and entering an intensive course seemed like just the ticket to level up my skills.</p>
    <p>I've been telling myself "If you're not growing you're dying" and "You get out what you put in". </p>
