    <p>After studying Ruby for several weeks, our Dev Bootcamp curriculum has moved to JavaScript.</p>
    <p>I'm sad to see Ruby go. It has so much built in "sugar" that makes it easy to write clear and concise code.</p>
    <p>But JavaScript dominates the web world, so we need to know it inside and out if we're going to become web devs.</p>
    <p>I think it was a great Trojan Horse to get DBC students started with beginner-friendly Ruby and then transition into JavaScript.</p>
    <p>I felt pretty naked at first when I was making my way around JavaScript. I felt like I had to build everything from scratch instead of just using the easy Ruby built-ins.</p>
    <p>But in researching for this blog, I found I may have been overreacting.</p>
    <p>I took a look at some of the most common/powerful array methods in Ruby (select, map, reduce) and found their brothers in JavaScript (filter, map, reduce).</p>
    <h3>Select / Filter</h3>
    <p>The idea behind select / filter is to only return the elements in the array that match your criteria.</p>
