    <p>After studying Ruby for several weeks, our Dev Bootcamp curriculum has moved to JavaScript.</p>
    <p>I'm sad to see Ruby go. It has so much built in "sugar" that makes it easy to write clear and concise code.</p>
    <p>But JavaScript dominates the web world, so we need to know it inside and out if we're going to become web devs.</p>
    <p>I think it was a great Trojan Horse to get DBC students started with beginner-friendly Ruby and then transition into JavaScript.</p>
    <p>I felt pretty naked at first when I was making my way around JavaScript. I felt like I had to build everything from scratch instead of just using the easy Ruby built-ins.</p>
    <p>But in researching for this blog, I found I may have been overreacting.</p>
    <p>I took a look at some of the most common/powerful array methods in Ruby (select, map, reduce) and found their brothers in JavaScript (filter, map, reduce).</p>
    <h3>Select and Filter</h3>
    <p>The idea behind select (Ruby) and filter (JavaScript) is to only return the elements in the array that match your criteria.</p>
    <p><strong>Select in Ruby</strong></p>
    <p><script src="https://gist.github.com/briankennedy1/472e7e8fa059bd5723f1.js"></script></p>
    <p><strong>Filter in JavaScript</strong></p>
    <p><script src="https://gist.github.com/briankennedy1/c61dfd0bddea001c7111.js"></script></p>
    <p>Hmmm, these examples look very similar. The biggest difference is that you need that big funky <code>function</code> declaration in JavaScript. In Ruby you just use the code block inside the curly braces to do that.</p>
    <p>Maybe this isn't so bad.</p>
    <h3>Map</h3>
    <p>Map is used to return a new array with elements that have been modified by your code block.</p>
    <p><strong>Map in Ruby</strong></p>
    <p><script src="https://gist.github.com/briankennedy1/56e9a56fc566bf5d1cd3.js"></script></p>
    <p><strong>Map in JavaScript</strong></p>
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/briankennedy1/0e7fe068ba406a87360b.js"></script>
    <p>Once again, these two pieces of code are not that different.</p>
    <h3>Reduce</h3>
    <p>Reduce brings the elements of an array down to single value based on your code block.</p>
    <p><strong>Reduce in Ruby</strong></p>
    <p><script src="https://gist.github.com/briankennedy1/e69d5ea032fdf70fd0f9.js"></script></p>
    <p><strong>Reduce in JavaScript</strong></p>
    <p><script src="https://gist.github.com/briankennedy1/8d256bac1112dce3dddc.js"></script></p>
    <p>Yep, you have to write <code>function</code> and <code>return</code> explicitly in JavaScript, but otherwise these look very similar.</p>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>This is a very superficial exploration for someone transitioning from Ruby to JavaScript, but I think it shows that the languages are similar enough to translate with ease.</p>
