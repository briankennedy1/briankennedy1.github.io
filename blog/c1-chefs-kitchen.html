      I've been on a journey of self-improvement for about a year now. I've read a bevy of books and taken direct action to improve myself. I learned you have to set goals and start moving towards them inch by inch to become successful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the goals I have for myself are:
      <ul>
        <li>Learn Spanish</li>
        <li>Do the <a href="http://www.popsugar.com/fitness/How-Do-Splits-3551904#photo-3551904">splits</a> (front or side, doesn't matter)</li>
        <li>Do a "back tuck" <a href="http://gph.is/15uIVSW">backflip</a><br/></li>
        <li>Learn JavaScript</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      As I started exploring the various options to teach myself JavaScript (<a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a>, <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/">Eloquent JavaScript</a>, <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/">Code School</a>, etc.) I stumbled upon the idea of a coding boot camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      I checked out <a href="http://www.hackreactor.com/">Hack Reactor</a>, <a href="http://www.makersquare.com/">MakerSquare</a> and <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/">Dev Boocamp</a>. They all had great pedigrees and scratched where I was itching.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was something about Dev Bootcamp. It had an emphasis on touchy-feely, new age principles - and I loved that. It aligned perfectly with my overarching goal of becoming the best version of myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Listening to Shereef's fireside chat about the Kitchen vs. Restaurant approach solidified my choice of Dev Bootcamp. In the talk he says that some people pay their money and expect to be delivered an education - the restaurant mindset. But he wants us to bring the kitchen mindset - that we're all in this crazy learning experiment together and that above all else <strong>you get out what you put in</strong>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      My mantra for most of my life has been "You get out what you put in". I even have an idea for a tattoo that would remind me every day that <strong>you get out what you put in</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm so excited to start my Dev Bootcamp journey. Nervous, excited, confident, not so confident. It's a big mix of human emotion that I'm sure everyone in my cohort is also feeling. Let's get going on this wild ass ride!
