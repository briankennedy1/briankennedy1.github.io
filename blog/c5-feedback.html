    <p>A big part of the Dev Bootcamp experience is pair programming. Two minds thinking together, catching errors and solving problems as one.</p>
    <p>We're all remote learners right now, so we use Google Hangout video calls to communicate and show our code. It's not as great as being in person, but it's pretty good.</p>
    <p>I've had some really fun, challenging pairing experiences so far. Busting through a tough problem and on to victory is a great feeling. It's a drug that I'm starting to get addicted to.</p>
    <p>I have had a few instances where I thought we were heading down the wrong path when working on a tough challenge. It's tough to speak up in those situations, as I was just as befuddled as my partner, and they MAY have been on to something. But I did my best to bring them back to reality and focus on a simpler solution. It has worked out every time... so far.</p>
    
    <p>I'm sure there will come a day when two stubborn minds will collide, and I will need to back down and let us wander until it's my turn. I have no problem backing down, as long as we can set a time limit on the wandering.</p>
    <p>Web development, like all things, is a human endeavor. I've read many times that the failure of software is really a failure of the team to communicate. I'll keep working on my communication skills.</p>

    <p>Another big piece of the Dev Bootcamp experience is feedback. We give and receive "kind, actionable and specific" feedback after every pairing session. </p>
    <p>My feedback has been mostly positive, and that makes me feel really good. But I know I probably talk too much and dominate the session too much. So those are things I'm working on.</p>
    <p>Writing feedback is tough. Although Dev Bootcamp doesn't want us to serve up shit sandwiches (compliment)criticism(compliment), it's pretty hard not to. In my experience people are really sensitive to <strong>how</strong> you say something compared to <strong>what</strong> you say.</p>
    <p>That being said, I have also worked with people that were incredibly matter of fact and clear communicators. Those type of people usually make you feel like shit initially, but they get their message through loud and clear.</p>
    <p>I'd like to fall somewhere in the middle. Clearly communicate a hard message with a not-so-sharp edge.</p>
    <p>I include constructive criticisms into every piece of feedback. It's still a work in progress.</p>
