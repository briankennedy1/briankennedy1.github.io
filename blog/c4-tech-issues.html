    <p>I recently picked up a copy of <a target="_blank" href="http://37signals.com/rework/">Rework</a> by Basecamp founders <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/jasonfried">Jason Fried</a> &amp; <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/dhh">David Heinemeier Hansson</a>. I loved it. It felt like they jumped into my head and wrote the book from what they saw.</p>    <p>A problem in tech, and in most companies, is <strong>too much bullshit</strong>. The layers and layers of bullshit start piling up once you start hiring more and more people. Once your company needs outside investors to survive. Once you need a bunch of rules about the refrigerator and coffee pots.</p>
    <p>The back cover of the book hits on some of my favorite axioms: ASAP is poison. Meetings are toxic. Planning is guessing. Fire the workaholics.</p>
    <p>After reading the book I watched a few more talks by David Heinemeier Hansson. The drumbeat is the same each time: Build a small, profitable business. Work remotely. Send people home at 5:00.</p>
    <p>My favorite sound byte from all of DHH's talks was: <strong>Don't add force, reduce friction</strong>.</p>
    <p>This has been one of my common-sense mantras for years. But in my experience, people just want to add more force. More complications. More layers of bullshit.</p>
    <p>Peel off the layers. Examine your processes. Why do it at all? Automate. Script. Shortcut at every chance. Someone out there has already done it, you can to.</p>
    <p>I love the idea of starting my own little business that has a handful of employees and keeps us well fed. Not hitting the lotto of startups for $100 million in equity. Not going to work at a faceless corporation building some dead guy's dream.</p>
    <p>Building my own little dream and building it the best I can sounds like my kind of life.</p>
